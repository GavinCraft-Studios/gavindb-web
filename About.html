	<h2>About</h2>
	<p><h4>
		We were a team of game developers who are dedicated to bringing you only the best of our collective abilities. The team over the years has gone through many 
		different phases and ammount of members. When the team was founded in 2021 there was a total of
        three members, Including GavinCraft who was the main developer and programmer also the CEO, fated666 a basic artist, and rocwood a music designer. The team shattered after an 
        arguement involving fated and GavinCraft. However GavinCraft continued working on games in game jams and such until he found the current acting artist JJBester.
