        C# is the programming languadge used in the unity game engine and iss a useful languadge to know!
        In this set of lessons by Brackeys you will learn this languadge's basic functions and rules. If you
        want to learn more about this languadge you can visit it's wikipedia article (Find Below). After using
        C# for 2 years the programming knoledge has helped me learn othe languadges such as java, python, and 
        C++

        Programming is NOT one skill because of the countless programming languages.
        Every apiring programmer has to make this decison, What language do i start with?
        Every Language has its strengths and weaknesses, but it completely depends on what you want to make.
        (We will be codeing in the C# languadge for this series, see Below Article for more info)

    <p><h4>
        Every programmer needs a peice of software called an IDE or Integrated Development Enviornment to program in. 
        (We will be using Visual Studio Code By Microsoft, see thier website below.) We also require a framework to display our code in a
        console-like enviornment. (We will be using the .Net framework, again see website below).

        When creating a project remember to: </h4>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Create a new folder and in vscode click file, open folder and select your created folder</h4></li>
            <li><h4>In vscode go to Terminal, New Terminal this should create a terminal at the bottom of your screen</h4>

            </li>
            <li><h4>In the created console type: "dotnet new console" and hit the enter key, this creates files in our project</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Click on Program.cs in the file explorer, this is where your code will go!</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Use the shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+P to open a searchbar and look for: ".NET: Generate Assets for Build and Debug" click this option</h4></li>
            <li><h4>With these newly created files in your system open the folder and go to launch.json</h4></li>
            <li><h4>Go to around line 17 and change the "console" option from "internal console" to "externalTerminal"</h4></li>
            <li><h4>To run the program go to Run, Start Debugging. Make sure to have Console.ReadLine() at the bottom of your code</h4></li>
        </ol>
