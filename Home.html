	<h2>Welcome!</h2>
	<p><h4>This is the official website created by and for Gavin D.B.! I am a Christian Game Developer 
		who loves bringing joy to those who watch my videos. 
		Many people may be drawn away just because I am Christian; 
		but don't worry I am not going to hand out pamphlets. 
		All I want is to bring joy and possibly the message and 
		gift of god to those who watch my videos and play my games. 
		Here you can check out all our Games and even 
		learn how to create games for yourself!

	<h2>What is Game Development?</h2>
	<img src="Media\GameDev-3D Modeling.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 234.66px;">
	<p><h4>[Wikipedia]: Video game development (or gamedev) is the process of 
		developing a video game. The effort is undertaken by a developer, ranging 
		from a single person to an international team dispersed across the globe. 
		Development of traditional commercial PC and console games is normally funded 
		by a publisher and can take several years to reach completion. Indie games usually 
		take less time and money and can be produced by individuals and smaller developers. 
		The independent game industry has been on the rise, facilitated by the growth of accessible 
		game development software such as Unity platform and Unreal Engine and new online distribution 
		systems such as Steam and Uplay, as well as the mobile game market for Android and iOS devices.
