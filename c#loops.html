	<h2>Episode Notes</h2>
	<h4>Loops allow us to reapeat parts of our program. A for loop is used to reapeat code for a certain ammount of iterations which is represented by i. 
		The i loop starts starts by declaring the variable as in "int i = 0;" then we write the condition for the loop an example is "i < 10" or i is less than ten. 
		After the code is triggered we write i++ which represents an increase of 1. Here is a diagram to help you visualize:

	<h4>Another type of loop is a while loop,, which will keep running until a condition is true. The syntax for this loop is much easier because it is almost the same as an if
		statement. "While (This Condition is true) {//Execute this code}" Just be careful with while loops and make sure that the condition in your while loop isn't true forever.
