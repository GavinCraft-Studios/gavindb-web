    <p><h4>SnowCraze was created during the last week of 2022 and uploaded on Jan 1, 2023. "This was the second game me and JJBester worked on together and it will always have a 
        special place in my heart expecially because this was the most sucsessful game jam we had ever hosted. And yes that means we joined our own jam. Also we only got 8th so you
        can't say it was rigged. The game is a timed switch puzzle where you have to fight of the fire enemies and solve the puzzle, at the same time you also melt so..." said 
        GavinCraft, CEO of the Studio and Head Developer.
