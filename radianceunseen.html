    <p><h4>
        In the begining of 2023 I started a game known at the time as Project Saugeon. This project evolved into the game called Radiance Unseen. "The title of the game was chosen 
        with a purpose. Radiance was another of my game projects that i worked on for a week or two and realized i didn't want to continue. I wanted to pay homage to that game 
        because it was supossed to be what Down Under could have been. The Unseen came from the fact that we are trapped underground so the the name Radiance Unseen came to mind. 
        It represented important things to the established lore and gameplay and really mad the game feel important." said GavinCraft, CEO of the Studio and Head Developer.

    <p><h4>
        The game is still under development with no release date, this is to allow the developers ample time to work on the game and release it when its ready. The developers are 
        posting Devlogs of the development of the game. You can look into those at the GavinCraft Studios Youtube Channel.
